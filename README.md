# Encryption

First, you need install the netbeans with JDK and run the netbeans IDE.
Dowload the file (sss.zip) and open the file through the netbeans.

Run the file,

It's shows you the command line argument interface and it's ask you to enter the key for an action.
If you entered the key it gives you the certain function.
Manually you need to give the path of the file that you want to execute.
Then you give a path the encrypted file want to save. You need to mention the new file name for the encrypted file.
After you need to provide a password for that encrypted file.
Allocate the password it shows the success message and ask for the continuity. If you give "Y" will start the same procedure otherwise its exit from the program.
