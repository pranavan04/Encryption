# Encryption

First, you need install the netbeans with JDK and run the netbeans IDE.
Dowload the file (sss.zip) and open the file through the netbeans.

Run the file,

It's shows you the command line argument interface and it's ask you to enter the key for an action.
If you entered the key it gives you the certain function.
Manually you need to give the path of the file that you want to execute.
Then you give a path the encrypted file want to save. You need to mention the new file name for the encrypted file.
After you need to provide a password for that encrypted file.
Allocate the password it shows the success message and ask for the continuity. If you give "Y" will start the same procedure otherwise it's exit from the program.
The encrypted file appered like this format.

Again you can do the same methodology for decrypt the file.


# Decryption

When you give the key like "D" its travel to do the decryption function for the given encrypted file. 
So, we need to provide the file path manually.
Then you give a path the decrypted file want to save.You need to mention the new file name for the decrypted file.
After you need to provide a password for that decrypted file. Must need to assign the same password that you present for the encrypted file. If you type the incorrect password it's pop up the error message.
If the password is correct then it shows the success message and ask for the continuity. If you give "Y" will start the same procedure otherwise it's exit from the program.

Finally, After decryption you can get the file look like an original file.
